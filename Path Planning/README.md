# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program
   
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 50 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

## Project Implementation
Most of the implemented code is developed as in the walkthrough of the course project, the help functions included in the main.cpp file are used to obtain a suitable results.
The trajectory planner is composed of three main blocks:
1) Prediction algorithm
2) Behavior Algorithm 
3) Trajectory Generation Algorithm
The vehicle is able to travel more than one complete lap which was verified in several executions without exceeding the limit values of speed, jerk or limits of lane

###  Prediction
The prediction algorithm is based on a model that incorporates the behavior of the movement involved as observed in Lesson 3, for each dynamic object on the road:
1.1) Identify common behaviors (lane change, turn right, cross the road, erc.), In this case three behaviors are taken into account: go straight, turn
       to the left and turn right.
1.2) defines a process model for each behavior. In this case a linear motion model (Linear Point Model) or constant speed is defined.
       [ds dd] '= [ds 0]' + W
1.3) updates the beliefs of each behavior by comparing the observation with the output of the process model. 
### Behavior
The data of the telemetry function for the vehicle information as well as the data in sensor_fusion for the other vehicles are used to determine
the behavior of the vehicle according to two variables to be determined: lane change and vehicle speed.
for the first three states are distinguished:
1) stay in the lane
2) change lanes to left
3) change lanes to right

for the second variable the value in ref_vel is used to accelerate or decelerate the vehicle. First, the Euclidean distance of each vehicle is calculated with respect to my vehicle
(variable dist) in line 333 of the main file, also determines the lane of each vehicle from the variable d of the sensor_fusion vector (lines 336 to 353). the distance values are 
stored in an array whose columns correspond to the lanes and whose rows contain the distances to my vehicle and are updated every iteration, once you go through the data of 
the other vehicles, you get the vehicles that are closer to each lane (lines 384 to 390). the speed of each vehicle is captured (on lines 357 to 363) to project the value of the 
distance s and determine the acceleration or the deceleration of the vehicle (lines 444 to 451)

To determine the state, the information of the nearest vehicles in each lane is used and the change to the right or left is indicated if the distance of the vehicles in the other
lanes is greater than 20 meters and the distance of the vehicle in front is less than 80 meters (lines 393 to 437)


### Trajectory

The path generation process uses the spline library to interpolate via points (lines 511 to 535). These points are based on information from the sensor_fusion and
the output of the behavior block, the vehicle is commanded by a perfect controller

## Reflections
The current performance of the system is adequate for the simulated conditions,the speed of response for lane change can be improved as well as to react to vehicles that approach quickly 
from the sides or from behind. However for complex environments where multiple mobile obstacles may occur, it is necessary to incorporate
elaborate prediction techniques such as those mentioned in the course as well as designing a robust behavioral selection architecture probably employing hybrid techniques including
learning and dynamic model of the vehicle, finally a robust motion controller can be used that takes into account the possible disturbances of the system, this project is an excellent
starting point as a general scheme for an autonomous navigation system.
